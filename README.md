# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my **DSA Repository**!  
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms** as part of my Computer Science & Engineering curriculum and personal development as a competitive programmer.  

---

## 🚀 Goals of this Repository
- Build a strong foundation in **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**  
- Practice **problem-solving** techniques for **competitive programming**  
- Document learning materials for quick revision  
- Improve **coding efficiency** and **optimization skills**
